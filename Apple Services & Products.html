            Memory
            The M1 uses a 128-bit LPDDR4X SDRAM in a unified memory configuration. The M1 Pro has 256-bit LPDDR5 SDRAM, and the M1 Max has 512-bit LPDDR5 SDRAM. 
            Memory bandwidth
            The M1 SoC has 66.67 GB/s memory bandwidth, the M1 Pro has 200 GB/s bandwidth, and the M1 Max has 400 GB/s bandwidth. 
            Unified memory architecture
            The M1's memory architecture allows the CPU, GPU, and other cores to exchange information with each other. 
            Unified memory
            The CPU and GPU can access memory simultaneously, rather than copying data between areas. 
            Some devices that use the Apple M1 chip include: 
            MacBook Air (M1, 2020)
            This laptop has a 13.3-inch Retina display, 8 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of SSD storage. It also has two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports, a headphone and mic combo jack, and Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax. 
            MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020)
            This laptop has a 13.3-inch LED-backlit display, 8 GB of memory, and 256 GB of SSD storage. It also has two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports.</pre></figcaption>
